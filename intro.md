3. Follow the prompts to install Git!
4. If Git asks you which default editor to use, we recommend Visual Studio Code!

### Key Advantages of Visual Studio Code 

Visual Studio Code is a simple, code-centric integrated development environment (IDE).

- Available for Mac, Linux, and Windows

## What's Web Development?

Refers to all the activities related to building, creating and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming and databases management

### Front End, or Client-Side: (10min)

- Directly user-interactive website parts
- Technologies
  - HTML: Content
  - CSS: Layout
  - Javascript: Interaction

Any website, such as google.ca etc, which can be access by our browsers such as Chrome or Firefox

### Back End, or Server-Side:

- User-hidden functionality.
- Basically any language, but mostly **Node.js**, Python, Go, C#, Ruby etc

_NOTE: Full Stack developer: Someone who is familiar with both kinds of development, and can work on a website from start to finish!_

### Our first line of code in JavaScript in the browser:
The console.log() method outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string (with optional substitution values), or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.
```console.log('hello world')```

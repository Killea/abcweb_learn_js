* The box model has 5 parts:
  * **Content area**
  * **Padding area:** refers to the inner margin of a CSS box â€” between the outer edge of the content box and the inner edge of the border
  * **Border area:** it sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin
  * **Margin area:** it surrounds a CSS box, and pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout
  * **Width & height:** this properties set the width and height of the content box, which is the area in which the content of the box is displayed

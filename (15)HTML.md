## Tag Structure

* As HTML is a markup language we'll use tags to create HTML elements that will show the user the different document sections and content.
* A tag will have the following parts:
  * The `<` character defines the initial part of our tag
  * Then well add the `tagname` that we want to use
  * At the end we'll use the `>` character
  * We can call this void or empty element as it doesn't have any content
  ```html
  <tagname>
  ```

# Review and different topics

[<- Home](README.md)

We almost on our half way of the class, so it would be better to review some of the code and the lessons.

## run code in a browser and node 
Try to run code in node and browsers


## different browsers
To understand there are different browsers, different cores

## Get the sum of  1, 2, 3 ...... 100

There might be a lot of ways to solve this problem.
### Math Way

(1+ 100)* 50 = 5050

### JavaScript Way
How would you solve this problem? Create a file,  getSum.js,  and write the code in it.
We have 10 min for this question.


## Output the even number of 1, 2, 3 ...... 100
How would you solve this problem? Create a file,  getEven.js,  and write the code in it.

Our time is very precious, but I still want to give you a limited time to think about this problem.
We have 3 minutes for this question to think about it! 

Hint: Use a loop to solve this problem. And also need some math to help you.

The math signs we have learned so far:
## + - * / %


## Output the number starts with 3 of 1, 2, 3 ...... 5000  (five thousand)
How would you solve this problem? Create a file,  getStartWith3.js,  and write the code in it.
This is a little bit harder(maybe not) than the previous question. Not only use for loop but you need to use if statement and do something else. 

Sorry,No hint for this problem. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

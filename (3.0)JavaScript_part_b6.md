[<- Home](README.md)
### String concatenation ðŸ•™

- The `+` operator allows us to concat two or more strings together

  **Example:**

  ```js
  let name = "Juan";
  let space = " ";
  let lastname = "Perez";

  console.log(name + space + lastname);
  ```

- In this example we concat all values using the `+` operator
- We might not need to use a variable for the space and we can use a string literal instead

  **Example:**

  ```js
  let name = "Juan";
  let lastname = "Perez";

  console.log(name + " " + lastname);
  ```
- In this example we see how to use a literal value without being assigned to a variable

### Template literals

- In ES6 we have `template literals` that will help us write better string templates
- To write a template literal we use **``** (back-tick)
- Then we use the following syntax to add template values `${variable}`
- Once the code gets executed the JavaScript engine will replace the variable value inside the string one
- Take a look at the following example to better understand this concept
- [MDN template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)

  **Example:**

  ```js
  var name = "Pedro";
  var template = `Welcome ${name} to this great site`;

  console.log(template);
  ```

  - We can get the same result using templates or string concat
- Using templates looks like an easier way to do it!!

### NumbersðŸ•™

- JavaScript also supports number type
- This type of value doesn't use quotes

  **Example:**

  ```js
  let age = 38;
  let capacity = 50;

  console.log(age);
  console.log(capacity);
  ```

#### Practice

[Exercise 20](./exercises/js/ex_20.md)

[Exercise 21](./exercises/js/ex_21.md)

- A common mistake is to code numbers as strings

  **Example:**

  ```js
  let age = 38;
  let capacity = "50";
  ```

  > In this example we have two variables that it looks like we are assigning number values.
  > Age has a number type and capacity has a string value with the representation of a number.
  > Having different types allows us to do different types of operations, for example we can add or subtract numbers but not strings

- We'll talk later about doing math using number type values

### BooleanðŸ•™

- This type of value only accepts `true or false` as value

  **Example:**

  ```js
  let on = true;
  let voted = false;
  let married = false;

  console.log(on);
  console.log(voted);
  console.log(married);
  ```

### UndefinedðŸ•™

- A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type **undefined**
- A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value
- A function returns undefined if a value was not returned
- Also we can assign it as a value to a variable

  **Example:**

  ```js
  let variableWithoutDefinition = undefined;

  console.log(variableWithoutDefinition);
  ```

- We might need to assign **undefined** in some special cases

#### Practice

[Exercise 23](./exercises/js/ex_23.md)


### NullðŸ•™

- In JavaScript we also have a **null** value
- We can assign a variable a null value

  **Example:**

  ```js
  let nullVariable = null;

  console.log(nullVariable);
  ```
#### Practice

[Exercise 24](./exercises/js/ex_24.md)

### typeofðŸ•™

- The **typeof** operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand

  **Example:**

  ```js
  let name = "Marta";
  let age = 30;
  let married = false;
  let undefinedVar = undefined;
  let nullVar = null;

  console.log(typeof name); // string
  console.log(typeof age); // number
  console.log(typeof married); // boolean
  console.log(typeof undefinedVar); // undefined
  console.log(typeof nullVar); // object
  ```

- In this example we can see that typeof will return different values for different data types
- For **null** it will return `object`! Now that was unexpected...
- Object is a different type of JavaScript data value and we'll talk more about it in a different section

# Introduction to Development

## What will we learn

We will mainly learn about JavaScript. We will also lean knowledge of HTML and CSS.
Of course, we are going to try to write a few simple games that using JS.

## Computer programğŸ•™

A computer program is a sequence of instructions in a programming language that a computer can execute or interpret.

### Our first line of code in JavaScript in the browser:
The console.log() method outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string (with optional substitution values), or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.
```console.log('hello world')```

## Installing Git ğŸ•™

Git is a version control system that we'll use to save changes and deploy our app. We need to install Git!

1. Visit the URL https://git-scm.com/. Click "Download for Windows" and choose the 64-bit version. ![Download Git](resources/images/intro/git.png)
2. Select your operating system. (Windows 10/11 suggessted)
3. Follow the prompts to install Git!
4. If Git asks you which default editor to use, we recommend Visual Studio Code!

## Commonly used bash commands ğŸ•™

Bash commands is mainly used in Linux/Unix, by using git bash, we can use some the commands from Linux on Windows system.ğŸ™Œ
```bash
ls
dir

pwd
```
## Visual Studio Code 

### Key Advantages of Visual Studio Code 

Visual Studio Code is a simple, code-centric integrated development environment (IDE).

- Available for Mac, Linux, and Windows
- Key features include debugging, version control with Git, and intelligent code completion
- Supports 36 programming languages and offers customized tools and plug-ins to make your dev environment your own!

### Download Visual Studio Code ğŸ•™

1. Go to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Click the big **"Download for xxx"** button ![VS Code download](/resources/images/intro/vs-code1.png) _If you're having trouble, scroll to the bottom of the page and manually select the correct package for your system_ ![VS Code alternative download](/resources/images/intro/vs-code2.png)

3. Open the VSCode .zip file after it has finished downloading to set up Visual Studio Code. Your browser may let you open the file directly from the download page... ![VS Code extract](/resources/images/intro/vs-code3.png) ...or you may have to open your Downloads folder and select the .zip file: ![VS Code extract from folder](/resources/images/intro/vs-code4.png)

## What's Web Development?

Refers to all the activities related to building, creating and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming and databases management

### Front End, or Client-Side: ğŸ•™

- Directly user-interactive website parts
- Technologies
  - HTML: Content
  - CSS: Layout
  - Javascript: Interaction

Any website, such as google.ca etc, which can be access by our browsers such as Chrome or Firefox

### Back End, or Server-Side:

- User-hidden functionality.
- Basically any language, but mostly **Node.js**, Python, Go, C#, Ruby etc

_NOTE: **Full Stack developer**: Someone who is familiar with both kinds of development, and can work on a website from start to finish!_

## Next, Let's learn more about the internet

# Internet

[<- Home](README.md)

Our main goal for this course is coding, but we need to get to know a little bit more about the Internet and how it works.

## What is the Internet? ğŸ•™

The **Internet** is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.


[VIDEO: What is the Internet?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxcc6ycZ73M)

## How do we stay connected with the Internet?

The Internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks. 

### A simple network

When two computers need to communicate, you have to link them, either physically (usually with an Ethernet cable) or wirelessly (for example with WiFi or Bluetooth systems). You can connect as many computers as you wish. But it gets complicated quickly.

To solve this problem, each computer on a network is connected to a special tiny computer called a *router*. This router has only one job: like a signaler at a railway station, it makes sure that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer.

![Ten computers with a router](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8445/internet-schema-3.png)


### A network of networks

So far so good. But what about connecting hundreds, thousands, billions of computers? Of course a single router can't scale that far, but, if you read carefully, we said that a router is a computer like any other, so what keeps us from connecting two routers together? Nothing, so let's do that. By connecting computers to routers, then routers to routers, we are able to scale infinitely.

Now that works for inside your home but we want to connect outside our home. We can accomplish this by connecting our network to the telephone infrastructure, we need a special piece of equipment called a *modem*. This modem turns the information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.

![A router linked to a modem](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8451/internet-schema-6.png)

So we are connected to the telephone infrastructure. The next step is to send the messages from our network to the network we want to reach. To do that, we will connect our network to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that are all linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network. The Internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks.

## Finding computers

If you want to send a message to a computer, you have to specify which one. Thus any computer linked to a network has a unique address that identifies it, called an "IP address" (where IP stands for *Internet Protocol*). It's an address made of a series of four numbers separated by dots, for example: `192.168.2.10`.

That's perfectly fine for computers, but we human beings have a hard time remembering that sort of address. To make things easier, we can alias an IP address with a human readable name called a *domain name*. For example, google.com is the domain name used on top of the IP address `173.194.121.32`. So using the domain name is the easiest way for us to reach a computer over the Internet.

![Show how a domain name can alias an IP address](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8405/dns-ip.png)

## Packets explained

Earlier we used the term "packets" to describe the format in which the data is sent from server to client. What do we mean here? Basically, when data is sent across the web, it is sent as thousands of small chunks, so that many different web users can download the same website at the same time. If websites were sent as single big chunks, only one user could download one at a time, which obviously would make the web very inefficient and not much fun to use.

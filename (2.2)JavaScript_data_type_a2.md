# JavaScript part A (data types)

[<- Home](README.md)
🕙🕙
- To execute a JS program we'll use the node command and the name of the file that we want to execute

```bash
node a.js
```

- Once we execute this command Node.js will read and interpretate our JS code
- We use the `.js` extension for our JavaScript code
### Using a Node.js file 

- Create a folder with the name `js`
- Create a new file `index.js` inside the js folder
- Write the following code into the index.js file

```javascript
2 + 2;
```

- Open the console and change directory to the `js` folder
- Execute the program using the node command:

```bash
node index.js
```

- Check out the output!!
- Don't worry if you don't see an output, Node.js executes our code but it's only adding both values together
- To show the result as output we need to use the `console.log()` object and method
- The `log()` method accepts any value to show as output
- Now add `console.log` and execute the program again

```js
console.log(2 + 2);
```

```bash
node index.js
```

- Now we see the expected output!!!

### Conclusion

- Browser and Node.js internally use the V8 JavaScript engine to run JavaScript code
- We can use the Browser or Node.js console to try out JavaScript code
- V8 is maintained by Google
- We'll use browser to run JavaScript client side and Node.js for Server side

## Variables declaration

- Many times when coding we need to store a value to interact with it
- This value is stored in our computer memory
- As this values might change over time we'll call this memory position a `variable`
- We can assign variables a `name` to identify them
- It's a good practice to use descriptive names to define our variables
- If we use names like a, b, foo they don't add any context about what we're coding
- We can then define that variables are named memory positions where we can assign different values and override them when needed

Nowadays, we use ```const``` , ```let``` to define a variable; However, you could see the that some code were written with ```var```, which is similar to ```let```.

```bash
const a = 1;
```

```bash
let b = 'let it be';
```

```bash
var c = "I'm old"
```

## Data types in JavsScript

* Number

The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.

```
const thisIsANumber = 123.45;
```
* BigInt

In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than ($2<sup>53</sup>-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -($2<sup>53</sup>-1) for negatives. It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.

BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.

A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:

// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
```
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

* String

String is quite simple in JavaScript.
A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.

In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.

    Double quotes: "Hello".
    Single quotes: 'Hello'.
    Backticks: `Hello`.

* Boolean (logical type)

The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

For instance:
```
let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked
```
* The “null” value

The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.

It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:
```
let age = null;
```

* The “undefined” value
The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.

If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:
```
let age;
```
* Objects

 Objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. 
```
 let o = {
     a : 1,
     b : 2,
     c : 'c',
 }
```
* Symbols

The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. It's not commonly used and we just mention it here to show there is a symbol type in JavaScript, we will have a better understanding when we get familiar with the ```objects``` type.
```js
const symbol1 = Symbol();
const symbol2 = Symbol(42);
const symbol3 = Symbol('foo');
```

Next class we will review most of those data types and have more exercises.👍
